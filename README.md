> 🚧 **Status:** Under Construction

*Originally evolving from a series of older, local homelab iterations, this project was ultimately dubbed **TheOneLab**—reference to "The One Ring" (One Lab to rule them all!).*

The lab utilizes a custom fork ([springboot-kafka-streams-microservices-demo](https://github.com/GiannisStathoudakis/springboot-kafka-streams-microservices-demo)) of [ZaTribune's Spring Boot Kafka Streams Demo](https://github.com/ZaTribune/springboot-kafka-streams-microservices-demo), which has been heavily modified and adapted to be natively compatible with this GitOps infrastructure project. 

It acts as a comprehensive e-commerce microservices application featuring multiple Java Spring Boot services, MySQL database integration (utilizing Vault's dynamic credentials), and real-time event-driven streams powered by Redpanda.

## CI/CD & DevSecOps Pipeline

To ensure secure, automated, and reproducible delivery, the microservices utilize a streamlined **DevSecOps** pipeline powered by **GitHub Actions** and **Helm**:

* **Pre-Build Security Scans:** Source code is actively scanned for hardcoded secrets using **GitLeaks** and statically analyzed for vulnerabilities (SAST) using **Semgrep**.
* **Build & Containerize:** Java applications are built via Maven and packaged into minimal container images using Docker Buildx.
* **Post-Build Vulnerability Scanning:** Before distribution, **Trivy** scans container images for OS and library-level CVEs.
* **Image Registry & Provenance:** Production-ready container images are pushed to the **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** alongside generated Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs).
* **Helm Chart Delivery:** Application workloads are packaged into standardized **Helm Charts**, allowing declarative GitOps deployments seamlessly managed by ArgoCD and promoted by Kargo.
